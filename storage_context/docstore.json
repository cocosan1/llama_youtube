just\nfinished watching the game and it was an\nabsolute belter of a game and so many\ninteresting tactical points\ncame from it in terms of what Jurgen\nklopp did the changes that he made I\nthought were absolutely fascinating as\nwell there were mistakes I think from\nJurgen klopp and there was the right\nsubstitution that was Darwin Nunez who\nstepped in an absolutely took the game\naway from Newcastle Newcastle fans I\npresume you are absolutely shell-shocked\nright now\nlet me know how you feel in the comments\ndown below\nlet's get straight into this because\nthere's so much to talk about I mean\nfirst of all in terms of like the game\nitself I think clock got this totally\nwrong in terms of an away game\nagainst a Newcastle United side\nthat place at St James's Park and does\nwhat they do\nyou've got so many techie players use\nthem you've got so many techie players\nuse them here the thing that matters\nmore than anything is battles it was all\nabout battles this game for me\npersonally and let me explain exactly\nwhat I mean when I say that because this\ngame there was some fantastic\nperformances from the the Newcastle side\nespecially in that first half of the\ngame but for me the game was massively\nabout control and when you are a livable\nside with the Tactical equality of\nsabajlai McAllister Endo who I thought\nwas really really impressive Trent\nAlexander Arnold as well gakpo who likes\nto drop deep as well look let's Chuck\nDiaz in there as well and you don't have\nto worry about Salah either when you've\ngot all these players and you're coming\nup against a side like Newcastle who\nhave one thing that's really important\non their side which is the crowd\ncontrol the game control the game didn't\ndo it and it came down to battles\nactually really key battles and let me\nCircle them for you this was one\ndefinitely gonna talk about that I think\nI thought uh Joe Linton and saboj light\nin that first 20 odd minutes was an\nimportant one to tanali and McAllister\nDiaz and trippier was one to a point I\nthink yeah it was Salah who actually\ndrifted quite a lot so I wouldn't say\nthat I would say look you've got the\ncenter-backs up against that Striker\nthat's going to be a key one as well\nthis is going to be a crucial one as\nwell if we talk about it let's get rid\nof it and talk about them kind of one by\none but for me the big big the main\nthing the route to all the problems for\nLiverpool in this game for 85 of it or\n85 minutes of it was\nnot controlling the game but a change\nhappened once the player was sent off\nVirgil Van dijk let's talk about\nAlexander Arnold first and foremost\nbecause I think we have to talk about\nthe fact that should have been sent off\nlook this is going to be a massive\nproblem here where by the letter of the\nlaw and there's no allowance for um for\ncommon sense\nshould you get should you get a booking\nfor the first one by the letter of the\nlaw yes and it's almost like the refs\nhave obviously been told to do this so\nhe you know he's like straight away\ngoing yeah I can and then he gets\nhimself the ref gets himself into a\nwhole world of trouble because obviously\nthat second one uh occurs where he\npushes Anthony Gordon and he should have\nbeen booked for that second one\nabsolutely should have been booked for\nthat second one and the big problem I\nthink that Trent had in this game I\nactually tweeted once he was um booked I\nI was uh talking about the idea of maybe\nswapping\nof swapping Gordon and almoran just so\nthat you had someone to sort of go\none-on-one against him down this side\nbecause if anyone's going to make a\nchallenge then you know it's obviously\ngoing to be Alexander Arnold and you\nwant him to get that second booking but\nI think the thing that was wrong that\nwas a wrong take from me and the reason\nbeing Gordon two things first of all\nAlexander Arnold he plays so much more\nnarrow than a normal\num fullback so much more narrow than a\nnormal normal fullback does and that's\nbecoming a problem for him because\nhonestly no one wants to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

here\nand here is night and day because what\nyou have is you have a defender in that\nin that touchline and if you are playing\nfullback you can go okay look I'm going\nto show you down this way\nand if you go down there I'm going to do\nmy very best if you get a cross in so be\nit we've got Bodies In The Box and if\nyou come into this side I've got sabaj\nlie back I've got Endo back I've got\nSalah on his way back I should be fine\nbut when you're playing so much more\nnarrow it just makes life so much harder\nfor yourselves and that's what that's\nwhat was a massive problem for for two\nthings and what I will say is\nAnthony Gordon was living in Trent's\nhead rent free for the bulk of this\nfirst half I thought he got himself back\ntogether in the second half and did okay\nand actually I I felt like Newcastle\ndidn't really focus on that enough and\nI'll explain that in just a second\nexactly why because Liverpool used a\nvery clear tactic in the second half and\nthe first half once they went down to 10\nmen\nbut\nAnthony Gordon was on his mind\nthroughout and so the goal the goal\nactually comes from that Salah plays the\nball back to Trent who's kind of in a\nnarrow position here and he can see\nthat Gordon is coming straight at him\nand he's concerned and because of that\nthat's why he has that terrible touch\nallows Gordon to get in and he scores\nhis goal actually let's give\nlet's give oh no wrong one hang on\ngo getting gold Becca\nNaughty Boy\nso that's his fault\nand then actually if you watched back\nthe sending off and again let's have a\nlet's talk about the pairings once again\nyou know in terms of people getting the\nbetter of each other in those battles\nwhich are always so important what again\nwhen it comes back to that lack of\ncontrol on the game was a real problem\nhere because actually the gate where the\ngame was played you had McAllister and\nDenali kind of on on either side so\nBorgia I was constantly trying to stop\nthose passes from guemeraj and into him\nthere so Joe Linton was often behind him\nin those half spaces so that was a\ntricky battle for us to Borg who I\nthought had a really good game in\nseveral different roles and though I\nthought was shielding pretty well\nbut Trent Alexander Arnold once again\nbecause he's been booked Gordon gets the\nball\nGordon gets the ball let's give him the\nball Gordon gets the ball and Alexander\nArnold he is so scared that he's gonna\ngo down this way and just cook him that\nhe thinks oh as long as we go inside I'm\nokay I'm safe\nespecially when you're you know in line\nwith the 18 yard box then being five\nyards from the from the touchline and so\nbecause of that and because of the fact\nthat he'd been on a booking as well he\nlets him Ghost Past him he there isn't a\ntenacity there there's not he's not very\nDynamic and you know he's not assertive\nin what he's trying to do in terms of\nstopping Gordon because of two things\nand let's be honest one is obviously\nhe's on a booking two Gordon Goes Down\nEasy\nlet's be honest come on\nso he lets him go and when he lets him\ngo that obviously allows for Gordon to\nplay that pass into Isaac here let me\nshow you and when he plays that pass\nthere's been a lot talk about it you\nknow is he the last man blah blah blah\nwith Virgin Van Dyke don't make the\nchallenge\ndon't full stop don't make the challenge\nlet's be honest it's a great pass that\ncuts through and he is through on goal\nthis is a guy who does he's not gonna\nhave a Bad Touch there he is through on\ngoal this isn't like high up the pitch\nthis is he's like just outside the\nPenalty Box so it's absolutely ascending\noff for me and the thing I don't\nunderstand why that isn't being said\nenough is you are on the wrong side of\nhim so focus on that use your arm\nand and take him away from goal don't\njust crunch through him\nawful from Vegeta that is so unlike him\nas well and again maybe there are",

these\nguys certainly for alexandrano in terms\nof allowing him to do that\nand I was having to deal with Joe Linton\nwhich he was great movement from him to\ncreate that space for him\nbut Virgie Van Dyke doesn't need to get\ninvolved he just doesn't need to get\ninvolved at all and I don't know what he\nwas thinking\nso it's definitely ascending off the\ngoal is a disaster Trent is lucky to be\non the pitch in in terms of my opinion\nand so of course they are now down to 10\nmen so what happens and just to finish\noff in terms of because it's probably as\ngood as it got for Newcastle and what\nNewcastle did really well was they had\nGordon they had Almer on they got the\nball and then came inside both of them\nwere happy to do that and I thought\nthere was some great running from tonali\nthere's great running from Joe Linton\nwho have got so much tenacity and and to\ngive them their flowers that is the big\nthing about Newcastle and again I'm\ngoing to say for the last time when\nyou've got all these techie players\nLiverpool have to control the game away\nfrom home and quieten down the crowd and\nthey didn't do that they sort of went\ntoe-to-toe with them and it was poor you\nknow I thought I made a few poor passes\nI thought Gap pose really poor and Trent\nwas honestly in quicksand for the first\nhalf of the game which is again not very\nvery like him and actually I think we\ncan probably go I bet you his passing\nstats were pretty awful let's have a\nlook\nwhere are you young man where reveal\nyourself reveal yourself let's just go\npassing let's go accurate passing let's\ngo find Trent 64\n64 pass actually now I know he tries\npasses I get it but still not good\nenough so what happened once they went\ndown to 10 men\nthey did what they should have done at\nthe start of the game which was utilize\nthe players that they had\nand importantly a really smart thing\nthat young Club did now I I thought they\nshould put Nunez on earlier on\nreflection there could have been you\nknow the the right level of game\nmanagement here let's I'll give him the\ncredit he maybe deserves young klop\nknows more than me when it comes back to\nfootball so here's what happened Diaz\nwent off\nGomez came on and obviously Virgil Van\nDyke got sent off went to a back four\nEndo stayed on and it became certainly\nout of possession geckpo came over here\nSalah went and played up front\nso but what they did do and they started\nto creep into the game in the sort of\nlast five or so 10 minutes let's say\num of that first half because salary is\nalways a threat in any of these\npositions if he gets the ball he's able\nto turn he's going to hurt you right Joe\nlynson's going to want to get on\nnaturally as the game progressed Joe\nLinda was so high Gordon was really\nreally high as well\npinning Alexander Arnold who's actually\nthey really didn't utilize that was the\none thing I thought was really\ndisappointing utilize that long pass and\nactually Liverpool were the opposite for\nsome time of it Robertson was trying his\nlong passes and it didn't work for me\nwithout the ball as I say it was a back\nit was a 4-4-2 but what they started to\nrealize that with the ball gakpo could\ncome and get involved Salah could be\nhere McAllister could be here as well\nand when you're defending in terms of\nnewcastle's side these players kind of\ncome out of the game because actually\nthey're focusing on being you know being\nattacking threats and the game what they\nstarted to figure out is that the game\nneeded to be played here in the center\nof the pitch and actually Alison Alison\nand Trent said some really revealing\nthing things in their post-match they\nspoke about mentality I think their\nmentality to a point has a part to play\nin here in terms of The Growing Pains of\nNewcastle\num Alison spoke about making the pitch\nsmaller and that's exactly when he said\nthat I was like that's exactly what I\nsaw myself and the substitutions really\nhelped with that in the second half of\nthe game as well so those are the two\nthings that I thought were really\ninteresting from those those post",

that's\nwhat started to occur and what they did\nhere was they allowed themselves to have\noh forget that one allow themselves to\nhave basically five on three let me just\nshow you that five on three\nif I can do it yeah so five on three in\nthat center of the pitch and that means\nthat you can keep the ball when you've\ngot really talented players on the you\nknow on the pitch and and they look to\ndo that and I thought that was really\nsmart because it meant you weren't\ngetting stretched you could work well\nthe pitch you've got dribblers here\nyou've got dribblers here but what I\nthought they weren't doing\nwas hurting the team hurting the\nopposition here so because if you're\ngoing to play narrow you want to play\nyou want to play vertical really you\nwant to be able to hurt teams in\ntransition quickly and with salads\npatrolling this sort of area I thought\nthey were missing something but slowly\nas the game progressed clop went for it\nvery very gently and I thought it would\nit to be fair it was clever but I would\nhave I would have liked Nunez on the\npitch so much um earlier but what was\ninteresting is that you know you kind of\ntake out these guys out of the out of\nthe game once you've got the ball so\nAlexander Arnold didn't really get\nforward at all I think we could probably\nhave a quick look at his average\npositions it's look this is one hell of\na game so I'm uh I'm gonna go all over\nthe place here hopefully but hopefully\nyou'll join it and if you are enjoying\nit make sure you hit the Subscribe\nbutton we've got a massive week I hoping\nto do a Champions League draw\num live stream which could be it could\nbe really awesome so make sure you\nsubscribe for that and loads on the\nchannel this this week and as you can\nsee here kind of narrow but let's make\nthe substitutions really really narrow\nand what they look to do and of course\nyou've got 10 men here is go from\num what could have been a four two two\ntwo\nand because you've only got 10 men it\nbecame a four two two one let's go back\nto the tactics book shall we okay so\nhere we are so as those changes were\nmade\nand I I won't do it in the right order\nI'm sure but gakpo came off jotter came\non\nMcAllister came off\nElliot came on\nEndo came off\nI think maybe Kwanzaa came on for\nsomeone it was probably Matic but let's\nleave him on here because I don't have\nhim as something but Nunes of course\ncame on as well and so what happened\nhere was that you had jotter and Salah\nkind of playing\num into out\nand obviously they could come back and\nhelp out if they needed to defensively\nbut actually seller kind of just stayed\na lot of the time and they worked this\nway around oh\nbut with the ball with the ball is so\nimportant but the twos here you had two\nreally exciting attacking players in\nSalah and jota Elliot and subozlight as\nI say super super technical players who\ncan get on the ball pretty press proof\ncan dribble past the player as well I\nthought Newcastle made some mistakes in\nthe sense that tonali needs to stay on\nthe pitch for me I don't understand why\nhe didn't stay on the pitch that seemed\nreally odd to me because these two were\nreally really pressing now maybe they've\nworked their socks off and you take them\noff off but for me I think they are such\ndominant workers you lose a lot of\nenergy when you bring in Long staff and\num I kind of remember who the other one\nwas\nso Nunez comes on the pitch and that's\nthe massive difference between gakpo and\nNunes is is so simple because when\ngakapo is on the ball geckpo wants to\ncome this way and I think the important\nthing to say if you haven't seen it I\ndid a video a couple of weeks ago about\nDarwin Nunes saying why he will score 20\ngoals this season and a lot of you have\nhammered me for it understandably so\nbecause he hasn't bloody started\nfootball matches but go and watch that\nvideo because football's about profiles\nbut it's about the right kind of\nchemistry and it's also about space and\nI think that's where\nNunes was so important and I", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

of\nbotman and Shaw pushing up allowing\nthese guys to push up\nby playing the game\nin the middle of the pitch basically\nbetween the 18 yard boxes then also\nhaving someone like Nunes who is willing\nto stretch the play and also run into\nthese channels you give yourself a\nchance but also\nyou stretch it you bring bottom back you\nbring Shah back and if these guys want\nto come back then they can and that\nmeans you're further away from goal but\neven if you don't all this space for\njotter to hurt teams all this space for\nSalah to hurt teams and actually\nimportantly as well here for Salah here\nfor seller so much more room and\nactually jota and Salah like did a lot\nof movement around Darwin Nunez but\nDarwin Nunez was willing to make those\nChannel runs and at the end of it all\nthat's what cost them now look I know um\nbottom got\num injured and he came off burn came in\nit's a very different player but getting\nDarwin Nunes on the tip on the on the\npitch was the game changer but he did it\nin whatever minute was 71st minute 75th\nminute right so maybe he was looking to\nstay in the game until that point Becca\nmade um was you've got to talk about\nBecca seven big saves massive save from\nAlmer on as well and when we're talking\nabout the mentality here I think that is\nthe one thing and please don't take this\nthe wrong way Newcastle fans because\nit's not I'm not trying to\nI'm not trying to have a go at Newcastle\nand I think the jump from wow I can't\nbelieve we finished third to\nto we are pumping teams on the regular\nis going to take time and actually I\nfeel like this Liverpool side reminds me\na little bit of that Jurgen klop side\nearly doors where you've you know you\nhaven't totally got that control yet\nbecause I think there was a maybe an\nelement of sort of giddiness that wow\nwe're in control while we're in a good\nplace here we're gonna win this game\nagainst Liverpool we're pretty\ncomfortable but if you don't get that\nsecond goal the opposition have always\ngot a chance I thought Bruno gameras had\na really good game I think you can see\nfrom his tackles as well he was pretty\nimportant two key passes in this game\nground Jewels won nine of 15 uh aerial\nJewels one one of one\nfive tackles as well really important\nplayer for the team and it's one of\nthose where I think you're shell shocked\nif you're a Newcastle fan like you have\nto be right\nbut the change the weirdly the best\nthing that happened to Liverpool in this\ngame was getting a player sent off\nlike what what world are we living in\nwhen getting Virgil Van dijk sent off is\nthe best thing that happens to you in a\ngame fascinating so young Club I think\ndeserves some criticism because I would\nhave put him on much sooner I think it\nwould have given you a better chance of\ndrawing the game obviously it all worked\nout in the end right\nbut also I think\nlook making the pitch narrower was\ncrucial being able to take that Midfield\nout of the game to a point and utilizing\nwhat you've got I think control over\ngames is something that young klopp's\nnot really wanting to do a lot of the\ntimes he wants to press high he wants to\nget at them he wants a plane transition\nbut you played into newcastle's hands in\nin this one up until that point so\nunbelievable that Newcastle have lost\nthis game also just got to say\nHarvey Elliott absolutely superb when he\ncame on and I thought absolutely superb\nGomez got through the game\nNewcastle had a lot of chances\nlet's have a quick look at those stats\nas well actually\nexpected goals

on\nthat might have been a decent shout to\ngo and do that hang on let's take him\noff because you would have retained that\nwidth and I think there was an element\nhere when we come back to
